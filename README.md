# Vector-Indexes

A vector index library written in Go, this is purely for my interest in learning the fascinating data structures utilised in the construction of vector indexes. I have decided to build them from scratch in Golang, and test on them personal as well as public datasets. Below are the indexes I've implemented so far, and hopefully will keep adding to them!

## [Vantage Point Tree]()

One of the simplest vector index structure, which is just a subset of the KD Trees. These are more or less an extension of the binary tree data structure. Below is a code snippet on how to use it. For more details, visit the VPTree file.
